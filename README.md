## Unsolved Problems

- i'm working to integrate the python backend script with mongodb. The original uses a POSTgres db, so as of now it will not send notifications. 
- styling is basic in some areas due to authorization. hopefully will be working through that soon. 
- google authentication is required, which may prevent some users from using the site
